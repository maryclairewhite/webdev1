	<h1>Hello there!</h1>

	<ul>
		<li>MC (my nickname)</li>

	<h2>All You Need To Know About Me (and a little extra)</h2>
	<h3>I was born in April of 1996 and a lot of super awesome crazy exciting magical shit has happened since then. This is the highlight reel.</h3>
	<p>I am an only child- a <i>firstborn unicorn</i>, if you will. If I was trying to brag I would tell you that I was everyones favorite in terms of grandparents and aunts and uncles. <b>But</b> I’m not trying to brag, so I will say nothing in regards to my status on the scale of relatives. I have been both sassy and sensitive since day 1. At age 4, I enjoyed music by <a href=“http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AltMeuPkWRs”>The Offspring</a> and <a href=“https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtSDWq6HsJE”>Nelly</a> and my favorite movie was <a href=“https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBlAMqoJ5BA">Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me</a>. Arts and crafts quickly became my thing and never stopped by being my thing. 16 years later, I am paying money for arts and crafts to be my professional thing for life at the Creative Circus. I was accepted to the Circus based off a portfolio of things I made from my freshman year of high school to my senior year of high school along side an essay about how obsessed I am with 90s music. It just felt right to write from the heart- and my heart is a dave grohl shaped space filled with glitter and carbs. I love bread and I love music. I will travel anywhere to see bands I like (or to buy bread). Some of the bands I have seen in concert are:
	<ul>
		<li>Foo Fighters (4 times! I was able to snap this picture of Dave Grohl, my hero, in New Orleans.<img src=“http://41.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m5mwn83r3D1ryd2mno1_1280.jpg” alt=“Dave Grohl Being a Bad Ass”/> </li>
		<li>Red Hot Chili Peppers (twice! This is from the first time I saw them in Atlanta.)<img src=“https://41.media.tumblr.com/3a0013bd8db243e0eea6d1655e25c804/tumblr_o5stw8JcFJ1ryd2mno1_1280.jpg” alt=“Rock Out with Your Sock Out”/> </li>
		<li>Pearl Jam (I waited for 8 hours by the stage to be front row and then 45 minutes before they came on, I decided I’d rather go to the back to experience the concert with my mom. She’s my bestie for the restie.) <img src=“https://40.media.tumblr.com/7a447e3bfebd27b2d34fee6acd58b167/tumblr_o5stwx3HsT1ryd2mno1_1280.jpg” alt=“Me and 50,000 of my closest friends soaking up the Vedder Vibes”/> </li>
		<li>Soundgarden (Chris Cornell’s voice is so powerful!)<img src=“https://40.media.tumblr.com/2fbcc42b7ea8972860eac2d0f35f2b2d/tumblr_o5stnd4XF21ryd2mno1_1280.jpg” alt=“Such beautiful men…”/> </li>
		<li>Better Than Ezra (Twice- once at Jazz Fest, once in Atlanta!) <img src=“https://40.media.tumblr.com/336850a36a6b0e431a8ce4a2e2ca7458/tumblr_o5sup1ffg61ryd2mno1_1280.jpg” alt=“BTE in the ATL”/> </li>
		<li>Third Eye Blind <img src=“https://40.media.tumblr.com/1e81760c35fa16917299d60dab7eeff9/tumblr_o5suwtUPlI1ryd2mno1_1280.jpg” alt=“TEB was a soulful experience.”/> </li>
		<li>Bush (Gavin Rossadle was only a few feet away from me so I was too busy hyperventilating to take a photo…)</li>
		<li>Dave Matthews Band (Vibing too hard for photography again)</li>
		<li>Weezer (Twice again! Here’s them at Turner Field.) <img scr=“https://40.media.tumblr.com/a2dd7a07bdcef98365b6822442d92237/tumblr_o5suncCc7W1ryd2mno1_1280.jpg” alt=“Rivers Cuomo is funky fresh.”/> </li>
		<li>Aaron Carter (and that moment is when you remember I’m 20)</li>
	</ul>
	<p> I’ve seen a lot of neat stuff and done a lot of cool things. I have two tattoos, one of which I got on my 18th birthday with my mom, who bought it for me as a present. My mom is super cool and I’m sort of a carbon copy of her. At the same time, I’m similar to my dad as well. My parents have been divorced since I was two but in a cool way- the way where I have awesome step parents and my parents are friends and its not weird. Essentially, I have a giant family. I am also super close to my boyfriends family and this weekend I was asked to be my boyfriend’s sister’s maid of honor. My answer was a resounding hell yes because I <b>LOVE</b> parties. Not in a ‘let’s get wasted and make bad decisions’ way, but in a ‘matching plates and napkins and confetti’ way. Life is a special occasion and I’m addicted to the shindig. (rhcp reference for those who are still with us) I treat every day like its a holiday and my biggest source of joy is giving people presents. well, that and eating bagels. My 20 years has been a creative journey of discovering myself- a journey I will always be on- so my life story is more of a list of things about myself because all life really is is learning who you are and applying that knowledge to situations. I’m still young so I have a lot more to add to my story and I feel as though I am right on the edge of greatness. I live everyday excited to see what is going to be the thing that gives me that push. </p>
